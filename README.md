This is a repository where I follow https://weblab.mit.edu/schedule/ step by step.
## Some questions:
- Why do I have to set up an SSH connection to synchronize with `git` cli? How did the HTTPS-cloned repo fail to use the SSH authentication keys for `git push`? 
- It seems that I can use [personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) for sychronizing repos through HTTPS:
  - And to switch between SSH and HTTPS: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories
